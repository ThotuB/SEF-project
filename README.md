# Raccoony

Raccoony is a game browsing application, designed for a university project.

## Project Idea

Users can register and login as
``Customers`` or ``Providers``.

``Providers`` are able to publish and sell their games, while choosing between the options
of selling or renting their game.

Renting a game allows a ``Customer`` to own that game only for a specific time period.

``Customers`` can add money to their virtual wallet and buy or rent the games that ``Providers`` offered.
